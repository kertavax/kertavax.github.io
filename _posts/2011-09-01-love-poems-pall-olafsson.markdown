A series of love poems by Páll Ólafsson named Eg skal kveða um eina þig alla mína daga (roughly translated; I will write of only you for the rest of my days). The title is impressed on a red, loose leather which covers the creamy pages within and everything is held together with a thick, texture-rich seam.

To lend the poems a warm, personal feeling the beautiful and humanistic serif-typeface Adobe Jenson was applied throughout the piece.
