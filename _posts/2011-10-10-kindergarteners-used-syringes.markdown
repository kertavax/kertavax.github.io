We were briefed to make a powerful opening spread for a fictional magazine article. I thought of recent news where used syringes of drug addicts were being discovered around kindergartens.

In order to awaken a feeling of discomfort and worry—hopefully with a call to action, I made a real typographic illustration with used syringes so as if a kindergartener could have made up a lovely message to his or her mum. The message reads “Look what I found mum” with an accompanying smiley face at the bottom.
