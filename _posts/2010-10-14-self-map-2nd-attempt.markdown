A final version of a self-map. Listed are identifiers which I related to in the year 2010; overthinking, delay, envy, precision, resilience and honesty. On each of the four intersections, where the identifiers meet, there is a life experience that really had a lasting effect in my life. What is formed from these intersections is the one thing that still defines me to this day – music and its creation.
