An article, “Undir oki séríslensku bókstafanna?” by Gylfi Ólafsson in the 3rd issue of [Mæna](www.maena.is). The article's undertone apparent in the illustrations, custom lettering and data visualization is derived from the article’s content and title which roughly translates as “Under the Pressure of the Icelandic Letters?”

The Icelandic letters are a heritage that, in an increasingly global society, is sometimes a heavy burden which Icelanders need to carry on their shoulders. I used Saul Bass's works as an inspiration; his heavy and descriptive use of appropriate imagery fits perfectly with the article in attempt to awaken a feeling of contrasting weights and sizes.
