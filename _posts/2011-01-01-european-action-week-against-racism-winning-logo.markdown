My winning submission for a logo competition run by The Icelandic Human Rights Centre regarding their _European Action Week Against Racism_.

Despite having translation difficulties with the English headline, The Racist is the Other, the Human Rights Centre wanted the much needed self observation and evaluation to be obvious.

With my final proposal I wanted to underline those inner con icts in a quiet concept approach of negative and positive space.
