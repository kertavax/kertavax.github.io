It will be interesting to figure out which markdown operators are at work here in working with jekyll. Namely …

1. ordered list item 1
2. ordered list item 2, where _this_ is emphasized
3. ordered list item 3, where `this` is span-ed

{% highlight javascript %}
var name = "Egill";
var dribbling = true;
while (dribbling) {
	console.log(name);
	dribbling = false;
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight JSON %}
{
	"student_name": "Egill",
	"program": "Digital Futures",
	"degree": "MDes"
}
{% endhighlight %}
